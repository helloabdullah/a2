       <i>Born to a Niazi Pashtun family of Punjab in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his 
        international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the
        team's captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan's only 
        victory in the competition. Considered one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan was later inducted 
        into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat
        in the National Assembly in the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition member from Mianwali 
        until 2007. PTI boycotted the 2008 general election and became the second-largest party by popular vote
        in the 2013 general election. In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI became 
        the largest party in the National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with independents with
        Khan as prime minister.As prime minister, Khan addressed a balance of payments crisis with bailouts from
        the IMF. He presided over a shrinking current account deficit, and limited defence spending to curtail
        the fiscal deficit, leading to some general economic growth. He enacted policies that increased tax 
        collection and investment. His government committed to a renewable energy transition, launched the Ehsaas
        Programme and the Plant for Pakistan initiative, and expanded the protected areas of Pakistan. He presided
        over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic turmoil and rising inflation in the country, threatening 
        his political position.Amid a constitutional crisis, Khan became the first prime minister to be removed
        from office through a no-confidence motion in April 2022. In August, he was charged under anti-terror 
        laws after accusing the police and judiciary of detaining and torturing an aide. In October, Khan was
        disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan from taking office for the current term of the
        National Assembly of Pakistan, regarding the Toshakhana reference case. In November, he survived an 
        assassination attempt during a political rally in Wazirabad, Punjab.On 9 May 2023, Khan was arrested
        on corruption charges at the Islamabad High Court by paramilitary troops who smashed their way into 
        the courthouse. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan resulting in the arrest of several thousands 
        of Khan's supporters along with military installations being ransacked. After his release, he blamed 
        the Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir for his arrest. He was sentenced to a three-year jail term on 5 August
        2023 after being found guilty of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession that
        were received during diplomatic visits abroad. On 29 August 2023, a Pakistani appeals court suspended
        Khan'blos three-year prison term, and granted him bail. However, Khan still remained incarcerated in
        connection with a diplomatic cypher case where he stood accused of leaking state secrets and violating the
        Official Secrets Act.On 30 January 2024, a special court sentenced Khan to 10 years in prison after
        he was found guilty of making public the contents of a secret cable sent by Pakistan's ambassador in Washington 
        to the government in Islamabad.</i>
