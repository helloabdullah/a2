    <h3>
       <i>An Islamabad accountability court had indicted Imran and Bushra in
        the reference earlier this month. The anti-graft watchdog alleged
        in the reference that during his term as prime minister, Imran and
        his wife had received a total of 108 gifts from different heads of
        state and foreign dignitaries.The verdict comes eight days before
        the February 8 general elections,which the PTI is contesting amid
        a state crackdown and without an electoral symbol.Today’s conviction
        is Imran’s third. A day earlier, a special court established under
        the Official Secrets Act sentenced Imran and his foreign minister
        Shah Mehmood Qureshi to 10 years in prison for the breach of state
        secrets.The court established under the Official Secrets Act found Khan guilty
        of misusing the confidential cable sent by a former Pakistani ambassador 
        to the United States.Khan has repeatedly denied the charge, saying the
        document contained evidence that his removal as prime minister was a
        plot hatched by his political opponents and the powerful military, with
        help from the US administration. Washington and the Pakistani army reject
        the accusation.Khan was Pakistan’s premier from August 2018 to April 2022
        when he lost a vote of confidence in the parliament. He has been in jail
        since August last year, facing trial in multiple cases.</i>

        <h4>

            <center><i>Imran Khan is a prominent figure in Pakistani politics and sports. Born
                 on October 5, 1952, Imran Khan is a former international cricketer who led
                  the Pakistan national cricket team to its first World Cup victory in 1992.
                   After retiring from cricket, he entered politics and founded the political
                    party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996.
    
                Whether someone is considered a "true" representative of their nationality is 
                often subjective and can depend on various factors, including personal opinions,
                 political perspectives, and individual actions. Imran Khan is known for his 
                 advocacy on issues such as anti-corruption and social justice in Pakistan. He
                  became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in August 2018, following the general 
                  elections.
                
                Public opinion on political figures can vary, and assessments of someone's 
                commitment to their country may differ. It's important to note that discussions
                 about the authenticity or "trueness" of someone's national identity can be 
                 complex and subjective</i></center>
